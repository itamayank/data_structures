# data_structures
If you are interested in Data Structures and Algorithms and understands its value in the field of Software Development
then this repository belongs to you. There are so many codes coded in best way possible in terms of time and space complexity in
the uploaded files. I have covered all types of data structures here and all you need to do is that just go through them for the better
understanding. 
First try to solve problem of your own.
If you solve it , then go and match the solution and see which one is better and why.
This step will gradually change your way of thinking and coding.
If you stuck somewhere and unable to solve the problem then go to the solution and see where were you missing.


Happy Coding :)
