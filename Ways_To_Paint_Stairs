	 * we have to paint given stairs by given colour with condition is that
	 *  we cannot paints two yellow steps directly after each other.*/
   
   
   //solution
	
/*    Case 1: When we have 1 stair, we can paint either yellow or green.
      Case 2: When we have 2 stairs, we can paint first stair by either yellow or green 
      but for next stair we can only paint by green because we cannot paint two yellow steps directly after each other.
       So total cases are three YG, GG, GY.
      Case 3: When we have 3 stairs then we can paint it by in 5 ways.*/
